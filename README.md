## Activity 3
*Briefly summarize what are the Flask context globals.* \
 In order to avoid view function from clustering a lot of not necessary arguments coming from the requests, \
 the context makes certain variables globally accessible, as well as prevent interfering with other threads.(shown following) \
 - application_app
   - current_app
   - g
 - request_context
   - request
   - session
